**DBMS Mini Project (VTU)**  
**Author:** M Shyam Prasad

## 📌 Introduction

The **Online Examination System** is a conceptual design for managing MCQ-based online exams. This project includes the SQL code required to create the database schema and populate it with sample data. It is intended for educational purposes, especially for understanding how relational databases can be used in examination systems.

## 🗂️ What’s Included

- SQL scripts to:
  - Create necessary tables (e.g., students, questions, exams, results)
  - Define relationships between entities
  - Insert sample records for testing and demonstration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Database:** MySQL
- **Script Type:** SQL

## 📦 How to Use

1. Open a MySQL-compatible database tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or command-line).
2. Create a new database (e.g., `online_exam_db`).
3. Import the SQL script into the database.
4. Explore the schema and sample data to understand how the examination system is structured.

## 🏫 Ideal For

- Students learning database design
- Mini projects in DBMS courses
- Practice with SQL schema creation and queries
