Introduction

The Online Examination System is a web-based application designed to conduct and manage multiple-choice question (MCQ) examinations efficiently. Built using PHP and MySQL, this system automates the examination process, reducing manpower, saving time, and ensuring accurate result generation. It allows administrators to manage exams, questions, and student data, while students can register, take exams, and view results seamlessly. This project is ideal for educational institutions or organizations looking to digitize their examination process.
